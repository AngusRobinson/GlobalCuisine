### Global Cuisine popularity

This is an attempt to clarify YouGov's data on which countries' food is mostly appreciated by the rest 
of the world. 

You can find the original survey data 
[here](https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/xi8t95fua3/YouGov%20-%20Global%20Cuisine%20survey.pdf).

The answer is that Italian food is most beloved, followed by China, Japan and France in that order. The country most appreciative of foreign cooking is 
the Philippines, and there is a slight negative correlation between how popular a country's cuisine is and how much it appreciates foreign food.
